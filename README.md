# VIPER TEMPLATE

I usually use VIPER architecture for my projects (yes, I really like it!), but seems a little bit tricky create files. So I decided to lear more about custom templates and thanks to [@Juanpe](https://github.com/Juanpe) I created my own module for Xcode.

Install: `sudo swift install.swift`
